## Dependencies

The framework depends on:
- the cinolib library, which is included as a submodule ;
- Triangle library, which is included as a submodule;
- Metis, which is included as a submodule;
- Qt framework, including Qt Charts module, which is assumed to be installed on the local machine (version 6.8.0 or later);
- Boost library, which is assumed to be installed on the local machine.
- Docker App, which is assumed to be installed on the local machine, and open when using PEMesh.

Note that, in the settings of the Docker App, a "Resource Saver" mode is activated by default after some inactivity time. 
This option should be disabled for the correct functioning of PEMesh.

## How to make it work

Please, use --recursive when cloning this repository.

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/DanielaCabiddu/PEMesh.2.git`

In the following, please consider `${REPO_ROOT}` variable as the folder where this README.md lies.
PMesh can be built by running either QMake or CMake. 
In both cases, the PMesh executable will be available in the `${REPO_ROOT}/build` folder.

### QMake 

First, build triangle library

`cd ${REPO_ROOT}/external/triangle`\
`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`make`

Then, build PEMesh by running the following commands:

`mkdir -p ${REPO_ROOT}/build`\
`cd build`\
`qmake ../src/PMesh.pro`

### CMake

Run the following commands:

`mkdir -p ${REPO_ROOT}/build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ../src`\
`make`

Triangle library will be automatically built by CMake.

### Docker

In both cases, after the installation open Docker App and run the following commands:

`cd ${REPO_ROOT}/solver`\
`sudo docker build --no-cache -f Dockerfile --target siggraph_2024_solver . -t siggraph_2024_solver:1.0.0`
